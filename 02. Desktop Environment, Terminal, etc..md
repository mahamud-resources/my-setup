#### 1. XFCE as Desktop Environment
I always use customized xfce desktop environment.
* The first thing I do after installing xfce DE is to enable dropdown terminal. Go to Settings > Keyboard and add new item under Application shortcut. Command: `xfce4-terminal --drop-down` Shortcut: `~`. Start using this setup and surely you'll become addicted.
* Change XFCE Themes & Icons:
    * I use [XFCE-look.org](https://www.xfce-look.org) website to download themes & icons sets.
    * After download & extract, just place the icons & themes folder to /usr/share/icons & /usr/share/themes respectively.
    * Then change Style & Icons from Applications > Settings > Appearance. And themes from Applications > Settings > Window Manager.

#### 2. ZSH as TERMINAL
* Changing themes OR installing plugins are very easy by just editing the ~.zshrc file.
* ZSH is very useful when used as terminal. It has loads of plugins & themes available online.
    * [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is one of the most useful app to use with zsh terminal. Install 'oh-my-zsh' as follows:
        ##### via curl
          sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
        ##### via wget
          sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
    * [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) is another useful plugin to use with Z shell. It is useful in the way that it'll show you your previous typed commands while you type. This is a real time-saver.
