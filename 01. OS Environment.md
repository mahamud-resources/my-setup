#### 1. XFCE as Desktop Environment
I always use customized xfce desktop environment.
* I use [XFCE-look.org](https://www.xfce-look.org) website to download themes & icons.
* After download & extract, just place the icons & themes folder to /usr/share/icons & /usr/share/themes respectively.
* Then change Style & Icons from Applications > Settings > Appearance. And themes from Applications > Settings > Window Manager.

#### 2. ZSH as TERMINAL
* ZSH is very useful when used as terminal. It has loads of plugins & themes available online.
* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is the most useful app to use with zsh terminal. Install 'oh-my-zsh' as follows:
    ##### via curl
      `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
    ##### via wget
      `sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"`

Changing themes OR installing plugins are very easy by just editing the ~.zshrc file.
